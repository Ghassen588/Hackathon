# 🌾 Smart Irrigation Dashboard (Mission 3)

A simple, voice-assisted dashboard that helps small farmers monitor their fields, plan irrigation, and understand weather conditions — **all in Arabic**.

Built for **WiEmpower 2.0**, this project focuses on **accessibility and ease of use**, especially for **Mme Mabrouka**, a local farmer who prefers Arabic speech and text.

## 💡 Why we built it

Most smart-farming tools are complex and written in English or French.  
Mme Mabrouka needed something **she could understand instantly**, without reading long texts or navigating confusing menus.

So, we created a dashboard that **speaks Arabic, listens, and guides her step-by-step** — literally.

## 🌍 What makes it easy for Mme Mabrouka

- 🗣️ **Arabic voice instructions:** Clear spoken messages tell her what to do — “الأرض جافة، من الأفضل السقي اليوم” (“The soil is dry; it’s best to water today”).
- 🕌 **Full Arabic interface:** Right-to-left layout and simple, familiar words.
- 🔄 **Automatic language detection:** The app starts in Arabic if her phone or browser is set to Arabic.
- 🗺️ **Color-based map:** Yellow means dry, blue means wet — no text needed.
- 🌦️ **Weather made simple:** Big icons and short Arabic phrases (“مشمس”, “ممطر”) explain the forecast.
- 🔐 **Easy login:** Uses CIN + password, no email required.

> She can open the app, hear what’s happening, and act — without reading or typing.

## 🌦️ What it does

- Shows **field zones** and their current moisture.
- Speaks **Arabic alerts** when watering is recommended.
- Displays **weather updates** in simple visual and spoken form.
