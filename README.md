## 🌱 About

Our project was built to help **Mabrouka**, a farmer from Zaghouan, manage her land’s water with **ease, clarity, and confidence**.  
Instead of complicated apps, she gets **a simple Arabic-friendly dashboard** that speaks her language — both literally and visually.

We designed it so Mabrouka can make the right decision at the right time, without stress or guesswork.

> “If Mabrouka can use it easily, we’ve done our job.”

## 💡 What It Does

- **Understands the soil:** Shows clear wet and dry zones so she knows when to water.  
- **Thinks with her:** Decides the right moment to irrigate based on real conditions.  
- **Speaks her language:** Arabic voice instructions guide her through each action.  
- **Keeps her connected:** Lets her check her field even when she’s away.  
- **Predicts tomorrow:** Suggests when to water next, saving time and water.

Everything is made to be **friendly, visual, and human** — no logins, no confusion, just help that makes sense.
